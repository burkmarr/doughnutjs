## TODO
- Implement Attr cleanup. For info, try this before the attribute presence check.
- Error trapping on invalid values to api functions
- Real units modifier - r
- Add options for arcs including gaps and rounded corners.
- Test and deal with images that are not square.
- Implement rough styles
- Fading of arcs towards outer and inner edge
- Test transitions across recipes
- Rough up – should just be a function to call on any path attribute in D3 stuff 
- Expmt with different rough up params, particularly the one that takes out the randomness 
- Experiment with converting shape rotations to a transform – should help on some roughed up styles
