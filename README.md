### TODO
- Add options for arcs including gaps and rounded corners.
- Test and deal with images that are not square.
- Rough up – should just be a function to call on any path attribute in D3 stuff.
- Expmt with different rough up params, particularly the one that takes out the randomness.
- Experiment with converting shape rotations to a transform – should help on some roughed up styles.
- Transition global needs to be replaced with optional params for transition e.g. duration, delay etc.
- Fading of arcs towards outer and inner edge.
- Error trapping on invalid values to api functions.
- Recipe load falls over if image not found.
