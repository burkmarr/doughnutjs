# Embedded Economy SVG and utility
## The SVG
An SVG of the Embedded Economy diagram has been created based on a JPEG image avalable from the
[DEAL website](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1KsZp26_dQPlnyEuM4nHVcFn7dwErfGcE). Text in the SVG is in 
English, but it would be quite easy to take a copy and edit
it in a text editor to translate the text. There may be some
positional issues wit the text. If there is a strong requirement for an SVG
in a lanaguage other than English, please raise an issue on
this repository to request it. If you modify the one provided
here to create a version for another language, please consider
raising a pull request to merge it into this repo (or contact
me separately).

Elements in the SVG have been marked up with CSS classes to make
modifying the appearance of elements, or groups of elements
relatively easy.
